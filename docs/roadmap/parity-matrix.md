# Parity Matrix — rax vs React Native vs Flutter

Every major capability, side by side. The target is the **union** of what RN and
Flutter offer, plus Rust-only advantages. Columns: does the ecosystem support it
(✓ / partial / —) and `rax` status (✅ shipped · 🟡 wip · ⬜ planned).

> "RN" = React Native core + the de-facto community stack (React Navigation,
> Reanimated, Gesture Handler, FlatList, Expo modules). "Flutter" = framework +
> first-party plugins.

## Rust-only advantages (where we aim to *exceed* both)
- Compile-time-checked UIs and exhaustive state handling (no runtime "undefined").
- Fine-grained reactivity: surgical updates, no per-frame tree diff.
- No GC: predictable frame budgets, no collection pauses.
- Memory safety without a VM; small binaries; fast cold start.
- One language across UI, business logic, and native modules.
- Per-subtree choice of native widgets vs. custom GPU rendering.
- **Super-customizability** as a first-class, audited guarantee.
